/**
 * Flywheel's backends draw with programs of their own, past the pack. They ask this before they call themselves supported
 * and it knows only Iris, so with an Opal pack Flywheel stayed on and Create's moving parts missed the pack's lighting. Told
 * the truth Flywheel falls back to {@code flywheel:off}, the same as under Iris without a compatibility mod, and Create draws
 * through its block entity renderers, which Opal maps to the pack's programs. Opal's own reload of the level renderer makes
 * Flywheel ask again when a pack goes on or off.
