/**
 * The mixins aimed at Sodium, kept apart from those aimed at the game.
 * <p>
 * Every target in here is an internal of a mod that renames and reshapes between versions, so a
 * Sodium bump rechecks each of them against the jar the build really resolves. Listing them is a
 * directory listing rather than a search; the two accessors on Sodium types live with the other
 * accessors in {@code dev.vitrail.mixin.access}.
