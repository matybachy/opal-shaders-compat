 * The material maps a pack reads beside the block atlas: which names they answer to, the atlases
 * a resource pack ships them in, and the flat textures that stand in where it ships none.
 * <p>
 * A leaf of the frame: nothing here reads the chain, the targets or a program. The frame asks it
 * which view serves a material name, and that is the whole of the traffic.
